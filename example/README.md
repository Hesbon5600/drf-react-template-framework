# DRF React Template Framework Example

This is an example Django app based on the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/),
which fully demonstrates the features of the framework.

The Django app is as bare-bones as possible, and is purely for testing purposes. It is not advised
to copy it directly, but instead to use it as a guide in your own applications. 

The main parts that should be focused on are:
- `viewsets.py`
- `serializers.py`
